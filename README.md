# Machine-Learning-Course

The purpose of the Machine Learning Course was to:

* To provide students with knowledge of classical machine learning algorithms, covering the topics of supervised learning (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimension reduction, pattern search).

* To familiarize students with the operation of neural networks and their learning methods, as well as the basic types of neural networks.

* To impart the practical skills needed to train models using the Python language and knowledge of the typical problems that arise when applying machine learning.

* To make students aware of the problem of unethical use of machine learning and the risks that arise from it.
